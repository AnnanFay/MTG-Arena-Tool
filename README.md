An MTG Arena deck tracker and statistics manager.

![History Screen](/Readme/screenshot_0.png)

### Current features
- In-game overlay, showing cards left in deck, complete deck and odds of card draws.
- Track your games and get historic data of all your matches.
- Individual deck statistics and w/l ratio.
- Support for all game modes (flash events/ quick draft / quick constructed/ ranked)
- Online decklists, see what decks are being used on events and how they perform. `WIP`


On Version 2.0.0 I move the source to Electron, mostly because its easier for everyone to compile/run and see the source. Also because it allow for FAR more interaction with the system (always on top made simpler, no crashes on simple bugs, multiple windows, etcetera).
We are currently merging all the feature from v1 to v2, if you want the most complete version you should download the installer here at GitHub, if you want the fastest and more stable version then you are welcome to try v2, trough you will have to run from source until its full featured.

### Compiling / Run from source
MTG Arena Tool is developed using Electron JS, To get started simply clone this repo and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool
npm install
npm start
```

### Download
Currently, we live [here at GitHub](https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool/releases). You will find all stable and pre-production releases right here.

Once downloaded the installer should guide your with ease, then simply run the app along MTG Arena. The app should read your user data and warn you if anything goes wrong.

[Scryfall.com](http://scryfall.com) in particular, for making an absolutely stunning database of every single card in the multiverse. These guys deserve all the love in the world for not only recompiling and uploading, but keeping the most up-to-date database with images, languages and pretty much every single bit of data we always hoped for in a MTG card search engine. Respect!
