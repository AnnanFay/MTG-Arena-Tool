### Compiling / Run from source
MTG Arena Tool is developed and built using GameMaker Studio 1.4, To run and compile from source you should own a legal copy of it.
You can download a trial/limited version to easily browse trough the code (or purchase if you like) at [YoYoGames.com](https://www.yoyogames.com/get)

### Download
Currently, we live [here at GitHub](https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool/releases). You will find all stable and pre-production releases right here.

Once downloaded the installer should guide your with ease, then simply run the app along MTG Arena. The app should read your user data and warn you if anything goes wrong.
Do not run the game while your are in a match! This may create a bugged entry in your history and possibly crash before you finish.
