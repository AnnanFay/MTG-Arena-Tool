An MTG Arena deck tracker and collection manager.

![History Screen](/Readme/screenshot_0.png)

## Current features
- In-game overlay, showing cards left in decks and time elapsed.
- Track your games and get historic data of all your matches.
- Collection browser (filter by set, show newly acquired cards, collection statistics, completion %)
- Individual deck statistics (color pie, mana curve, win/loss ratio, wildcards needed).
- Support for all game modes (flash events/ draft / constructed / ranked / etc)
- Online decklists, see what decks are being used on events and how they perform.
- Draft tracker and replayer

## Roadmap
`These are some features I would like to include, not ordered in any way`
- Log of events (Player X casts Y spell, This targeted that, etc), save the log too
- Metagame / Archetypes on decks explorer `this requires more data to be able to play with`
- Deck editor/modifier, for adding things like specific basic lands and then importing them to MTG Arena.
