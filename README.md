## Current features
- In-game overlay, showing cards left in decks.
- Track your games and get historic data of all your matches.
- Individual deck statistics and win/loss ratio.
- Support for all game modes (flash events/ quick draft / quick constructed/ ranked)
- Online decklists, see what decks are being used on events and how they perform.

## Roadmap
`These are some features I would like to include, not ordered in any way`
- Log of events (Player X casts Y spell, This targetted that, etc), save the log too
- Metagame / Arquetypes of explore decks `this requires more data to be able to play with`
- More stats in Deck view (mana curve, cards missing, wildcards value/required) 
- Deck editor, for adding things like specific basic lands and then importing them to MTG Arena.
